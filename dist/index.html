                                <p>Clothing is one of those materials that no matter how hard you try they end up
                                    looking quite
                                    dull. Missing that sheen.
                                    We took the best of some of the current cloth shader models from Facebook Ready at
                                    Dawn |
                                    Order 1886 cloth shader and CharlieD Imageworks
                                    cloth shader and then translate them into Unreal to bring them to you.

                                    We know that there is clearcoat is already included into Unreal, but we changed the
                                    rules of the game a little bit. We simply bring you some extras to it.
                                    By letting you add some imperfections and weathering to your clearcoat, by simplying
                                    using some masks. Plug-n-play and scratch that new car.

                            I was looking for a material library that would bring me enough flexibility for the scope of
                            my
                            project. MATLIB was exactly what I needed, bringing bunch of crazy options I never though
                            about,
                            bringing out the best of my props, and letting me just concentrate about other creative
                            aspects
                            of
                            my environment.
